## 📋 Requirements

You must have **BOTH** of the following Linux distributions installed and running:

### Required Distributions

| Distribution     | Version     | Type    | Purpose                     |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| 🔴 **AlmaLinux** | 10.1        | Minimal | Enterprise Linux experience |
| 🟠 **Ubuntu**    | 24.04.3 LTS | Desktop | User-friendly environment   |

### Installation Options

Choose **ONE** installation method:

1. **💻 Virtual Machines** (Recommended)
   - Both distros in separate VMs
   - Using VirtualBox, VMWare, UTM, QEMU, etc.

2. **🪟 WSL2** (Windows only)
   - Both distros as separate WSL instances
   - Quick and integrated solution

3. **🐧 Native/Dual Boot** (Advanced)
   - One or both as native installations
   - Best performance but more complex

4. **🔄 Hybrid Approach**
   - Mix of methods (e.g., one VM + one WSL)
   - Use what works best for your setup
